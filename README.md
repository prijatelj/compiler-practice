Rudimentary Compiler for Practice & Education
=

This is a practice compiler for a very simpified version of c written in 
c++. This project was done as a course project for the class "System 
Programming & Design" my sophomore year. The code is not optimized to the 
fullest extent and is not as efficient as possible, for it was not 
necessarially meant for that. The main objective was to recreate a compiler 
for a simplified code language to better understand the compiling process 
and the intricacies involved in basic compiling of code.
