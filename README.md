Rudimentary Compiler for Practice & Education
=
Semester of Spring 2016 @ Duquesne University

This is a practice compiler for a very simpified version of c written in 
c++. This project was done as a course project for the class "System 
Programming & Design" my sophomore year. The code is not optimized to the 
fullest extent and is not as efficient as possible, for it was not 
necessarially meant for that. The main objective was to recreate a compiler 
for a simplified code language to better understand the compiling process 
and the intricacies involved in basic compiling of code.

This code was written during the beginnings of my real programming
experience with c++ and is rough and imperfect. It is not to show off any of
my skills or expertise in c++. It is to merely depict my experience and
understanding of the rudimentary basics of compilers, along with serving as 
a testimony to my understanding of c++ in these 2500 lines of code.

This project is also before I began to follow better standards for coding 
practices. ie. 80 columns per line, more descriptive variable names, etc... (essentially GNU coding standards).
